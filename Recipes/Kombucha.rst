How to Brew 1 1/2 Gallons of Kombucha
=====================================

Recipes for batch brewing most commonly provide measurements and directions
for a 1-gallon batch, which happens to be a size that works well for
homebrewers. Unlike some ferments that are ready in just a couple of days,
kombucha requires time to mature. So making at least a gallon at a time
ensures there is enough (maybe!) to drink while waiting for the next batch.

Brewing a full gallon of kombucha requires a fermenting vessel that holds
at least 2 gallons to accommodate the SCOBY and starter liquid and give
adequate headroom for air circulation. If all that is available is a
1-gallon vessel, never fear — simply reduce the tea, sugar, and water by
25 percent. (See `Measurements, Brew Times <#measurements-brew-times>`__
for more details.)

This basic recipe reflects centuries of consensus developed through
experiments and research by brewers of all types from around the world.

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/2 gallon cool, chlorine-free water
- 6-9 tea bags or 2–3 tablespoons loose-leaf tea
- 1 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 large-size kombucha SCOBY (4–5 ounces)
- 2 cups mature kombucha for starter liquid

Directions
----------
1. Heat 1 quart of the water to just below boiling. Combine the tea and hot
   water in the pot, a separate bowl, or in the brewing vessel. Let steep
   for 5 to 15 minutes, then remove the tea leaves.
2. Add the sugar to the hot tea, and stir until completely dissolved.
3. Pour the remaining 5 quarts of cool water into the brewing vessel. If
   prepared separately, add the sweet tea. Dip a clean finger into the
   mixture to gauge its temperature. If warmer than body temperature (about
   100°F [38°C]), cover with a clean cloth and set aside until lukewarm.
4. With clean hands, place the SCOBY in the sweet tea solution. Pour the
   starter liquid on top of the SCOBY; this acidifies the pH of the tea
   near the top of the vessel, where the culture is most vulnerable,
   offering a layer of protection from potential pathogens.
5. Cover the vessel with breathable cloth, secured with a rubber band if
   necessary. Set it in a warm location (ideally 75–85°F [24–29°C]), out of
   direct sunlight, unless brewing in an opaque vessel. (At this stage you
   have the option to say a prayer, send good vibes, or otherwise commune
   with your new brew. It is a culture of living organisms and responds to
   energy — positive and negative.)
6. Allow the sweet tea to ferment for 7 to 21 days. After 5 days (or sooner,
   if you’re curious), it’s okay to begin tasting once a day. To taste,
   remove the cloth cover, gently insert a straw beneath the SCOBY, and take
   a sip. Or dip a shot glass or other small cup past the new layer of SCOBY
   into the brew.
7. Once the brew reaches the flavor you prefer, it is ready to harvest.
   Before bottling or flavoring, collect at least 2 cup of starter liquid
   for the next batch from the top of the brew (3 cups if you can spare it
   or if the brew is young) and pour it into a clean bowl. Then remove the
   SCOBYs to the bowl, cover with a clean towel, and set aside. (We take the
   liquid first because removing the cultures can kick the yeast off the
   bottom, which is fine for drinking but not for starter liquid.)
8. The rest of the kombucha is now available for drinking, either straight
   from the vessel or, more commonly, after bottling with or without flavors.
   For tips on flavoring, filtering, bottle-aging (to further develop the
   flavor and carbonation), and other advanced techniques.
9. To start the next batch, use one or both of the SCOBYs, either the
   original and/or the new one from the previous batch, with the starter
   liquid. The extra culture may be used to start another batch or placed
   in a SCOBY Hotel. Enjoy the first batch while the second brew is in
   progress!

Notes
-----
We usually prepare a 1-gallon batch right in the glass vessel. However, one
must use caution when doing so because pouring hot liquid into a cold jar
could cause the glass to crack, creating a dangerous mess. Most of the time
this is not an issue and precautions can be taken to prevent an accident
from happening.

One way to avoid the issue altogether is to prepare the quart of hot sweet
tea concentrate in a separate container than the fermentation vessel; it
could even be the pot used to heat the water. (It doesn’t matter what
material that container is made out of because there’s no acid content to
worry about.)

A benefit to adding the cool water to the brewing vessel first, then adding
the hot sweet tea concentrate is that it evenly distributes the heat and
prevents the bottom of the vessel from warming up. This means the
temperature of the liquid will drop faster and you can brew sooner. In fact,
waiting is usually unnecessary as the temperature is already under
100°F (38°C) with this technique.

However, there’s nothing wrong with preparing the sweet tea in the brew
vessel and adding the water afterward. Just make sure the glass is not so
cold as to crack when hot water is added.

When prepping the vessel, utensils, and counter, avoid antibacterial soaps,
which may have a negative effect on the culture. Instead, opt for very hot
water or a 1:1 dilution of distilled/pasteurized vinegar (never use raw
vinegar, as it will alter and potentially contaminate the brew). You may
also choose to “cure” the inside of the vessel by rinsing with distilled
vinegar or kombucha vinegar immediately prior to adding the sweet tea, but
this is optional.

Brewing DOs and Don'ts
======================

DOs
---
* Wash the prep area, vessel, utensils, and your hands with chlorine-free
  hot water. If needed, use small amounts of nonantibacterial soap, and then
  rinse well with hot water and cure with pasteurized vinegar or kombucha
  vinegar.
* Select a glass, food-grade ceramic, stainless steel (grade 304 or higher),
  wood barrel, or food-grade plastic vessel for brewing.
* Brew with filtered, distilled, spring, or bottled water.
* Brew with real sugar and real tea (Camellia sinensis). Organic is preferred
  but not required.
* Use a tightly woven, breathable cloth cover over your fermentation vessel
  to prevent contamination.
* Let the tea ferment in a relatively warm location with good airflow.
* Allow the brew time to develop before tasting it.
* Take starter liquid from the top of the previous batch.
* Make a SCOBY Hotel for extra cultures and as a source of potent starter
  liquid.
* Throw away any batch, both the liquid and the SCOBYs, that exhibits mold.

Don'ts
------
* Don’t use antibacterial soaps or chlorinated water, which harm the
  bacteria in SCOBYs. Other soaps may leave a potentially harmful residue
  as well.
* Don’t select a crystal, low-grade plastic, metal (aside from stainless
  steel), or decorative or antique ceramic vessel for brewing.
* Don’t brew with chlorinated or unfiltered tap water.
* Don’t brew with decaffeinated tea or herbal tea or with artificial
  sweeteners or sugar substitutes.
* Don’t use cheesecloth (the weave is too loose) or a solid lid (the
  kombucha needs oxygen).
* Don’t let the tea ferment in direct sunlight, in a closed cupboard, or
  in a cool location.
* Don’t disturb the fermentation vessel in the first five days. Too much
  movement prevents the new SCOBY from forming properly.
* Don’t take starter liquid from the bottom of the previous batch.
* Don’t store all SCOBYs in one brewing vessel — you won’t have any
  backups if that vessel is compromised.
* Don’t try to salvage a moldy batch of kombucha.

Measurements, Brew Times
========================

Excerpt From: The Big Book of Kombucha by Hannah Crum


Always brew in a vessel that is slightly larger than the desired amount of
kombucha. For example, a 1-gallon vessel holds about 3⁄4 gallon of sweet
tea plus the SCOBY and starter liquid. Small batches can be brewed in large
vessels if desired; the extra space is not an issue. The amount of sweet
tea roughly equals the batch size, as the starter liquid plus a little more
usually evaporates during the process.
