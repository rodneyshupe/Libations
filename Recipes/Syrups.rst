==========

Source: `Alton Brown <https://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/alton-brown/mint-syrup-reloaded-8806464>`__

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 cups (440 grams) sugar
- 10 sprigs (40 grams) fresh mint

Directions
----------

1. Combine the sugar with 1 cup of the water in a small saucepan and place
   over high heat. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to medium low and
   simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved — 3 to 5
   minutes. Remove from the heat, cool for 10 minutes, then transfer to
   your blender. Allow the syrup to cool to around 80 degrees F. Clean the
   saucepan.
2. Meanwhile, combine the 2 cups of ice and 2 more cups of water in a large bowl and
   have it standing by near the cooktop.
3. In the same saucepan, bring 5 cups of water to a boil over
   high heat and tie the mint into a bunch with cotton butcher's twine.
   When the water reaches a hard boil, dunk the mint bouquet and count to
   15, then immediately plunge the mint into the ice water to stop the
   cooking and set the color. (This is called "blanching" and "shocking.")
4. Once thoroughly cooled, pat the mint dry, pluck as many leaves off as
   possible, and add them to the cooled syrup. Then blend on medium speed
   until the mint is reduced to very fine pieces. Strain through a fine
   sieve set over a 2-cup liquid measuring cup then transfer to a bottle
   and refrigerate for up to 2 months or freeze forever.
