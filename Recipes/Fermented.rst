The first step to making a naturally carbonated, naturally fermented ginger beer at home; is creating a wild yeast natural ginger bug. This "How To Make A Ginger Bug At Home" video will guide you through the process of making a ginger beer starter and how to feed and care for it.

This is at least a 5 day process.


Ingredients
-----------
- 125g organic ginger*
- 150 mL (10 Tbsp) sugar**
- 500 mL (2 cups) water***

Directions
----------
1. Day #1: Chop up 25g of unpeeled organic ginger and place into a container
   with 500 mL of water along with 2 Tbsp of sugar. Stir or shake.
2. Day #2: Chop up 25g of unpeeled organic ginger and place into the container
   along with 2 more Tbsp of sugar. Stir or shake.
3. Day#3 - #5: Repeat as above. By day #3 you should see some bubbles in the mixture, this lets you know it’s working.

Tips:
* Use ‘organic’ ginger because this has the best chance of having a strong colony of yeast and bacteria.

** Any sugar will do, the yeast will eat whatever kind you put in. The type of sugar won’t affect the taste of your ginger beer, nor will any of the sugar you use end up in the end drinkers body.

***If your tapster is heavily chlorinated, use bottled water. Most municipal water now uses ‘Chloramine’ which isn’t as easy to remove as Chlorine was - so boiling or letting stand overnight doesn’t work.
