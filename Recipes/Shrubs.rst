Ingredient Combinations
=======================

* 2 cups rubarb (cut into 1 inch pieces), 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 cups red wine vinegar
* 1 cups each of strawberries, white sugar, red wine vinegar and a splash of balsamic vinegar
* 1 cups each of blueberries, thinly sliced ginger, cider vinegar
* nectarine + peppercorn + brown sugar + white wine vinegar
* peach + cardamom pods + honey + cider vinegar
* pomegranate + peppercorn + white sugar + red wine vinegar
* pear + star anise + brown sugar + white wine vinegar
* red plum + cardamom + brown sugar + white wine vinegar (which is what I made here)

Hot Process Shrubs (Simple Syrup Method)
========================================

Directions
----------

1. Add equal parts of sugar and water to a saucepan, and heat and stir until
   the sugar dissolves.
2. Add berries or fruit and simmer until the fruit's juice blends well into
   the syrup.
3. Let that mixture cool. Strain out the solids.
4. Add vinegar to the syrup, bottle it all up, and store in the fridge.


Cold Process Shrubs
===================

Directions
----------

1. Wash and prepare the fruit. Most berries can be lightly crushed, even with
   your hands, if you prefer. Strawberries should be hulled and quartered.
   Stone fruit needs to be quartered and pitted.
2. Cover the fruit with sugar. A ratio of one part each of fruit, sugar, and
   vinegar, and that's a great place to start. So to, say, one cup of fruit,
   add one cup sugar. Stir to combine, cover, and stash in the fridge.
3. After several hours, or a day or two, your fruit should be surrounded by
   juice and syrup.
4. Strain the syrup away from the solids, pressing lightly on the solids to
   expel any stubborn juice. If any sugar is clinging to the bowl, scrape it
   into the syrup. It should settle to the bottom, underneath the syrup.
5. Add the vinegar, and whisk to combine, until sugar is dissolved.
6. Pour through a funnel into a clean bottle. Cap, shake well, and
   refrigerate.
7. Check the shrub periodically. Some sugar may settle out onto the bottom
   of the bottle. If so, shake well to combine. Eventually, the acids in
   the juice and vinegar will dissolve the sugar.

Hybrid Process Shubs
====================

Directions
----------

1. Chop or slightly crush the fruit/vegetable and then combine with sugar in
   a large mason jar.  Set out at room temp for approx. 1-2 hours until the
   fruit/vegetables start to release their juices.
2. Place in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  Add vinegar and stir to combine
   then put back in the refrigerator for at least 1 to 2 days.  Pour through
   a fine mesh strainer and bottle.
