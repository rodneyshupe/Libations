Mulled Wine
===========

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 clementines
-  Peel of 1 lemon
-  Peel of 1 lime
-  2 tablespoons caster sugar
-  6 whole cloves
-  1 cinnamon stick
-  3 fresh bay leaves
-  1 whole nutmeg
-  1 whole vanilla pod, halved
-  2 star anise
-  2 bottles of Chianti, or other Italian red wine

Directions
----------

1. Peel large sections of peel from your clementines, lemon and lime
   using a speed peeler. Put the sugar in a large saucepan over a medium
   heat, add the pieces of peel and squeeze in the clementine juice. Add
   the cloves, cinnamon stick, bay leaves and about 10 to 12 gratings of
   nutmeg. Throw in your halved vanilla pod and stir in just enough red
   wine to cover the sugar. Let this simmer until the sugar has
   completely dissolved into the red wine and then bring to the boil.
   Keep on a rolling boil for about 4 to 5 minutes, or until you’ve got
   a beautiful thick syrup. The reason I’m doing this first is to create
   a wonderful flavour base by really getting the sugar and spices to
   infuse and blend well with the wine. It’s important to make a syrup
   base first because it needs to be quite hot, and if you do this with
   both bottles of wine in there you’ll burn off the alcohol.
2. When your syrup is ready turn the heat down to low and add your star
   anise and both bottles of wine. Gently heat the wine and after around
   5 minutes, when it’s warm and delicious, ladle it into glasses and
   serve.

-----------

- 2 cups (440 grams) sugar
- 10 sprigs (40 grams) fresh mint

3. In the same saucepan, bring 5 cups of water to a boil over
   high heat and tie the mint into a bunch with cotton butcher's twine.
   When the water reaches a hard boil, dunk the mint bouquet and count to
   15, then immediately plunge the mint into the ice water to stop the
   cooking and set the color. (This is called "blanching" and "shocking.")
4. Once thoroughly cooled, pat the mint dry, pluck as many leaves off as
   possible, and add them to the cooled syrup. Then blend on medium speed
   until the mint is reduced to very fine pieces. Strain through a fine
   sieve set over a 2-cup liquid measuring cup then transfer to a bottle

Shrubs
======

Shrubs are drinking Vinegar and are made with a 1:1:1 combination of
fruit/vegetable, sugar, and vinegar.

Directions
----------

Hot Process (Simple Syrup Method)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Add equal parts of sugar and water to a saucepan, and heat and stir until
   the sugar dissolves.
2. Add berries or fruit and simmer until the fruit's juice blends well into
   the syrup.
3. Let that mixture cool. Strain out the solids.
4. Add vinegar to the syrup, bottle it all up, and store in the fridge.

Cold Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Wash and prepare the fruit. Most berries can be lightly crushed, even with
   your hands, if you prefer. Strawberries should be hulled and quartered.
   Stone fruit needs to be quartered and pitted.
2. Cover the fruit with sugar. A ratio of one part each of fruit, sugar, and
   vinegar, and that's a great place to start. So to, say, one cup of fruit,
   add one cup sugar. Stir to combine, cover, and stash in the fridge.
3. After several hours, or a day or two, your fruit should be surrounded by
   juice and syrup.
4. Strain the syrup away from the solids, pressing lightly on the solids to
   expel any stubborn juice. If any sugar is clinging to the bowl, scrape it
   into the syrup. It should settle to the bottom, underneath the syrup.
5. Add the vinegar, and whisk to combine, until sugar is dissolved.
6. Pour through a funnel into a clean bottle. Cap, shake well, and
   refrigerate.
7. Check the shrub periodically. Some sugar may settle out onto the bottom
   of the bottle. If so, shake well to combine. Eventually, the acids in
   the juice and vinegar will dissolve the sugar.

Hybrid Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Chop or slightly crush the fruit/vegetable and then combine with sugar in
   a large mason jar.  Set out at room temp for approx. 1-2 hours until the
   fruit/vegetables start to release their juices.
2. Place in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  Add vinegar and stir to combine
   then put back in the refrigerator for at least 1 to 2 days.  Pour through
   a fine mesh strainer and bottle.

Ingredient Combinations
-----------------------
* 2 cups rubarb (cut into 1 inch pieces), 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 cups red wine vinegar
* 1 cups each of strawberries, white sugar, red wine vinegar and a splash of balsamic vinegar
* 1 cups each of blueberries, thinly sliced ginger, cider vinegar
* nectarine + peppercorn + brown sugar + white wine vinegar
* peach + cardamom pods + honey + cider vinegar
* pomegranate + peppercorn + white sugar + red wine vinegar
* pear + star anise + brown sugar + white wine vinegar
* red plum + cardamom + brown sugar + white wine vinegar (which is what I made here)
